### ID Scanner

Technical Stack: Python, React Native, and SQL

1. Backend Development:
   - Language: Python
   - Framework: Flask or Django (for building the web API)
   - Database: SQL-based database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)

2. Frontend Development (Mobile App):
   - Framework: React Native (JavaScript framework for mobile app development)
   - UI Components: React Native Elements, React Navigation
   - State Management: Redux or React Context API
   - HTTP Requests: Axios or Fetch API

3. Database Management:
   - SQL: Structured Query Language for database operations
   - Database ORM: SQLAlchemy (Python SQL toolkit) for database interactions

4. ID Card Scanning:
   - Python Libraries: OpenCV or PyTesseract for image processing and optical character recognition (OCR)
   - Barcode/QR Code Scanning: Python libraries like pyzbar or ZBar for scanning and extracting information from barcodes or QR codes

5. Authentication and Security:
   - Token-based Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and session management
   - Encryption: Python libraries (e.g., bcrypt) for encrypting sensitive data
   - Secure Communication: HTTPS for secure data transmission between the mobile app and server

6. Reporting and Analytics:
   - Python Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for generating charts, graphs, and visualizations
   - Data Analysis: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis

7. Deployment and Hosting:
   - Backend: Deploy the Python backend on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, or Google Cloud Platform.
   - Database: Host the SQL database on platforms like AWS RDS or Google Cloud SQL.
   - Frontend (Mobile App): Package the React Native app and deploy it on the respective app stores (e.g., Google Play Store, Apple App Store).

8. Additional Tools and Libraries:
   - Version Control: Git (for collaborative development and code management)
   - Development Environment: IDEs like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for Python, and Visual Studio Code or JetBrains' WebStorm for React Native development.
